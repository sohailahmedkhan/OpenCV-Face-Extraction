# OpenCV-Face-Extraction
This code can be used to extract faces from videos. The code works by getting individual frames one by one from the video and then extracts faces from the individual frames. This code extracts faces from every frame within the video, but can be changed to extract faces from different intervals.
OpenCV's CNN based face detection model is used to detect faces as it is robust against large poses or faces at distance.
